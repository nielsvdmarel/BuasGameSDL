red penguin sprites are modified versions of the original.

SDL tutorials I used: 
SDL playlist from "Let's Make Games":
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx

I started out with this tutorial to get a understanding of SDL, 
after a couple of episodes and a lot of modifications I felt comfortable enough with C++ and SDL to step away from the tutorial and create everything myself.

I also used a lot of online research for C++, the most helpful website was the website from LazyFoo:

SDL_TTF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIjj6UVXtXk&t=951s
I used this text SDL tutorial to get more understanding on how to use the SDL_TTF library. 

I used this sprite sheet from the original Pokémon mystery dungeon, downloaded on sprites-resource:

The ttf file I used is a Mario256 font I found online:

The main idea of my game was a remake of the famous Mario party game: Pushy Penguins in 2d.

I learned a lot from this BUAS intake assignment. There is a lot I’d like to improve or expand, But I wasn’t able to do this in time.
-- Known bugs: 
-Sometimes the player collides with two objects at the same time, and get’s sandwiched. As a result the player teleports out of both objects. 

-- Known improvements to make: 
-Add a restart without restarting the game itself.
-Score isn’t saved. 

Library’s used:
SDL,
SDL_TTF,
SDL_image.
